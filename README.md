# üé® AfriArtt: The Decentralized African Art Marketplace

**AfriArtt** is a decentralized NFT marketplace built on the **Hedera Hashgraph** network, dedicated to empowering African digital artists. We merge cultural authenticity with modern Web3 infrastructure, providing a transparent, global platform for artists to tokenize their work and earn automated royalties.

## üõë Problem Statement: The Erosion of African Cultural Heritage

The most pressing challenge facing African art today is the **accelerated erosion of traditional cultural practices**‚Äîincluding ancestral sculptures, ritual paintings, and historical writings. These art forms are rapidly *dying out* due to:

1.  **Generational Disconnect:** Knowledge transfer has broken down, leaving newer generations without the skills, context, or incentive to continue these ancient practices.
2.  **Lack of Visibility:** Traditional cultural art lacks a modern, global platform to gain recognition, appreciation, and sustained financial value, making it difficult for artists and custodians to justify their preservation.
3.  **Digital Inaccessibility:** Valuable traditional artworks and their stories are not digitized, leaving them vulnerable to decay, loss, and permanent cultural amnesia in the modern world.

**AfriArtt exists to stop this cultural erosion. We use Web3 technology to create a digital, immutable link to the past, offering new life, global visibility, and financial sustainability to the stewards of African cultural heritage.**

## üé® Data Schema Highlights (Supabase Tables)

Our PostgreSQL schema is designed to unify user identity across both the traditional Auth system and the Web3 wallet address.

| Table              | Key Attribute     | Relationship & Purpose                                                                                                  |
| :----------------- | :---------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`artists`**      | `user_id` (UUID)  | **Unified ID:** Links the Supabase Auth `user_id` to the `hedera_account_id` (wallet) and stores all profile metadata.  |
| **`nfts`**         | `hedera_token_id` | Stores all artwork metadata and unique Hedera/IPFS identifiers. Uses `user_id` as a Foreign Key to the `artists` table. |
| **`transactions`** | `hedera_tx_hash`  | Records on-chain sales, tracking the buyer/seller `user_id`s, sale price, and automated royalty distribution.           |
